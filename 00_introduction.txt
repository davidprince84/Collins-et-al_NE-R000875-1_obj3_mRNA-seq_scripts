Introduction

This GitHub repository contains the scripts and files necessary to reproduce the mRNA-seq
differential gene expression analysis from Collins et al. (2023), and the subsequent comparison
of lists of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from Collins et al. (2023) and other studies.

The analysis assumes that the GitHub repository and raw mRNA-seq read files have been 
downloaded from davidprince84/Collins-et-al_NE-R000875-1_obj3_mRNA-seq_scripts
 and GEO GSE175623 respectively.

Datasets included in the GitHub repository:

						 the fat body from 50-day-old wild-type flies.
korb_2021_table_s1.csv - Table S1 from Korb et al. (2021) containing genes from interacting endocrine pathways that are 
						 involved in the TI-J-LiFe  (TOR/IIS-JH-Lifespan and Fecundity) network.
pacifico_2018_table_s1_female.csv - The "Female" Excel tab from Table S1 of Pacifico et al. (2018) containing lists of all 
									differentially expressed genes in all pairwise age comparisons.

Overview of the numbered scripts:

General notes: The scripts were written on a Windows PC, therefore it is advisable to run dos2unix on the scripts 
			   before running them in Unix.
			   Scripts 01 and f_BuildDDSForDEAnalysis.R require the user to change a file path to make it
			   specific to their own computer. These instances are highlighted with CHANGE
			   or CHANGED in the comments.
			   Scripts whose names end with "tissue" need to be run with an argument denoting which tissue is to be
			   analysed. E.g:
			   ./10_quality_control_fastqc_tissue.bash head  
			   would run script 10 on the head samples. The other tissue arguments are fatbody and ovary.
			   Scripts whose name starts with "f_" are custom R functions called from multiple R scripts. 

Scripts 01 to 06 perform necesary preliminary tasks such as downloading genome-related files and indexing them, 
or downloading datasets for comparison.
01: Initiates directory structure for the rest of the analysis, moves the scripts and data sets into the
	correct directories. NOTE: instructions included for moving mRNA-seq files to correct directory.
02: Downloads fasta and gtf files for Drosophila melanogaster along with associated checksums files.
03: Verifies the integrity of the donwloaded files using checksums.
04: Indexes the D. melanogaster genome and transcriptome for HISAT2 and Kallisto respectively. 
05: Uses the D. melanogaster GTF to produce a file linking transcript and gene IDs, for use with tximport. 
	Generates a BED12 file from the GTF using Mikado, for use with RSeQC.
06: Downloads and formats the details for Drosophila melanogaster genes in the GenAge database.

Scripts 10 to 14 perform quality control tasks such as examining read quality with FastQC, checking alignment of reads
to the genome, pseudoalignment of reads to the transcriptome, and clustering samples with a principal component analysis (PCA).
10: Conducts FastQC analysis on the mRNA-seq reads and combines the results into a single report with MultiQC for the specified tissue. 
11: Aligns the mRNA-seq reads to the D. melanogaster genome using HISAT2 and combines the results into a single report with MultiQC for the specified tissue.
12: Examines the quality of the alignments generated by script 11 using RSeQC for the specified tissue.
13: Pseudoaligns the mRNA-seq reads to the D. melanogaster transcriptome with Kallisto for the specified tissue.
14: Produces a box plot to visualise the normalization and a PCA to visualise the clustering of samples in the differential expression analysis.

Scripts 20 to 25 perform differential expression analysis and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on the mRNA-seq data
from the current study.
20: Produces figures with summary plots and tables for the differential expression analysis.
21: Generate a data.frame which links D. melanogaster gene IDs to gene names.
22: Produces a table of the differential expression analysis and lists of differentially expressed genes for each tissue and treatment.
23: Produces heatmaps of the differential expression analysis for each tissue.
24: Performs gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on lists of differentially expressed genes from the current study, and produces tables of enriched GO terms.
25: Combines the GO enrichment results from script #24 into a single table.

Scripts 30 and 31 compare the differentially expressed genes between treatments within tissues.
30: Compares the lists of DEGs between treatments within tissues, and produces tables of statistcal results and overlapping genes.
31: Produces Euler diagrams summarising the results of script #30.

Scripts 40 to 45 compare the differentially expressed genes from the current study to lists of gene potentially associated with longevity in insect species.
40: Prepares D. melanogaster GenAge data for comparison with data from the current study in scripts 41 to 43.
41: Compares data from the current study to the D. melanogaster genes in the GenAge database, and produces a heatmap of the results.
42: Compares data from the current study to the D. melanogaster genes in the GenAge database, and produces a table of the results of statistical
	tests, and a table listing overlapping genes.
43: Compares data from the current study to the D. melanogaster differentially expressed genes in Chen et al. (2014) and
	Pacifico et al. (2018), and produces a table of the results of statistical 	tests, and a table listing overlapping genes.
44: Compares data from the current study to the Drosophila melanogaster genes in the TI-J-LiFe network, and produces a table of the 
	results of statistical tests, and a table listing overlapping genes.
45: Compares data from the current study to the Drosophila melanogaster genes in the TI-J-LiFe network, and produces a heatmap 
	of the results.

Script 50 gathers all the tables and figures from the analysis that are present in the manuscript, and copies them to a single folder for convenience.
