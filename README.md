This repository contains the scripts and files needed to reproduce the analysis of, "Developmental diet alters the fecundity-longevity relationship and age-related gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster" by David H. Collins, David C. Prince, Jenny L. Donelan, Tracey Chapman, and Andrew F. G. Bourke. The Journals of Gerontology: Series A, Volume 78, Issue 12, December 2023, Pages 2240â€“2250, https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glad199 

The csv files "NER0008751_Obj3_Exp3_dailyoff_3", "NER0008751_Obj3_Exp3_LH_data_v2", "NER0008751_Obj3_Exp3_mortality_rate" and "NER0008751_Obj3_Exp3_pupation_eclosion", together with the R scripts with names starting "NER0008751_Obj3_Exp3_" are needed to reproduce the "Aim 1: Effect of larval diet treatments on fecundity-longevity relationships" section of the results.

The csv files "chen_2014_table_s1", "korb_2021_table_s1",  and "pacifico_2018_table_s1_female", along with the text file "00_introduction", and the scripts with names starting with two digits (e.g. "01_initiate_directory_structure.bash) or "f_" (e.g. "f_BuildDDSForDEAnalysis.R") are needed to reproduce the "Aim 2: Effect of larval diet treatments on gene expression in adult females" section of the results.

The Excel file "Differential gene expression data from an experiment manipulating larval nutrition in female fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster).xlsx" contains tables D1 - D8.
